# Dimensions v6

Lot's of changes!

Package is being downscaled signicantly as it has too many weird things going on and is far larger than it needs to be

The main purpose of this package is to efficiently take an environment, written in python, typescript, whatever, and connect it with agents / models from any language, with high speed as well.

The secondary purpose is to then be able to use this connection to run Episodes (RL lingo here), to run tournaments, and generally some basic things

The package currently has all these weird extra dependencies (that come with vulnerabilities too) that are not needed and or should be made separate like all the plugins...

And has a wierd "option hierarchy system" that is not very nice.

And a lot of cross-platform issues with Windows...
