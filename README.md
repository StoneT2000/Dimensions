# Dimensions

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/dimensions-ai.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/dimensions-ai)

This is an **open sourced** **generic** **Artificial Intelligence competition framework**, intended to provide you the fully scalable infrastructure needed to run your own AI competition with no hassle.

All you need to do?

Code an **environment** and code a **bot**

Dimensions handles the rest, including match and tournament running, security, and scalability.

The framework was built with the goals of being **generalizable** and **accessible**. That's why Dimensions utilizes an I/O based model to run competitions and pit AI agents against each other (or themselves!), allowing it to be generic and language agnostic so anyone from any background can compete in your environment.
